# Vcard

## What is it?

This is a small project to improve my skills in CSS and HTML. One branch is built using Flexbox, and the other uses CSS Grid.

It’s a simple, fully imaginative business card— all the information displayed is fictional.

## What does it look like?

Here’s a screenshot of the site. It looks the same whether using Flexbox or Grid.

### Thank you for reading this README!

#### Be kind— I'm not a web developer, and HTML/CSS are not my primary skills. 😁
